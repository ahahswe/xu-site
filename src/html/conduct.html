            <h2><span class="hash"># </span>Code of Conduct</h2>
            <h3><span class="hash"># </span>About</h3>
            <p>
                Online communities include people from many different backgrounds. The XU contributors are committed to providing a friendly, 
                safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disabilities, 
                neurodiversity, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, age, religion, or similar personal characteristics.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first goal of the Code of Conduct is to specify a baseline standard of behavior so that people with different 
                social values and communication styles can talk about XU effectively, productively, and respectfully.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second goal is to provide a mechanism for resolving conflicts in the community when they arise.
            </p>
            <p>
                The third goal of the Code of Conduct is to make our community welcoming to people from different backgrounds. 
                Diversity is critical to the project; for XU to be successful, it needs learners and contributors from all backgrounds.
            </p>
            <p>
                We believe that healthy debate and disagreement are essential to a healthy project and community. 
                However, it is never ok to be disrespectful. We value diverse opinions, but we value respectful behavior more.

            <h3><span class="hash"># </span>Our Pledge</h3>
            <p>
                In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to 
                making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of 
                age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, 
                socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

            <h3><span class="hash"># </span>Our Standards</h3>
            <p>
                Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:
                <ol class="conduct-list">
                    <li>Using welcoming and inclusive language</li>
                    <li>Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences</li>
                    <li>Gracefully accepting constructive criticism</li>
                    <li>Focusing on what is best for the community</li>
                    <li>Showing empathy towards other community members</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
                Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:
                <ol class="conduct-list">
                    <li>The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances</li>
                    <li>Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks</li>
                    <li>Public or private harassment</li>
                    <li>Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission</li>
                    <li>Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting</li>
                </ol>

        </div>
        <div class="main-content">
            <h3><span class="hash"># </span>Our Responsibilities</h3>
            <p>
                Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected 
                to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.
            </p>
            <p>
                Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, 
                wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily 
                or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

        <div class="main-content">
            <h3><span class="hash"># </span>Scope</h3>
            <p>
                This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing 
                the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project 
                e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an 
                online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.
            </p>
            <p>
                This Code of Conduct also applies outside the project spaces when the Project Stewards have a reasonable belief 
                that an individual’s behavior may have a negative impact on the project or its community.
            </p>

            <h3><span class="hash"># </span>Conflict Resolution</h3>
            <p>
                We do not believe that all conflict is bad; healthy debate and disagreement often yield positive results. 
                However, it is never okay to be disrespectful or to engage in behavior that violates the project’s code of conduct.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you see someone violating the code of conduct, you are encouraged to address the behavior directly with those involved. 
                Many issues can be resolved quickly and easily, and this gives people more control over the outcome of their dispute. 
                If you are unable to resolve the matter for any reason, or if the behavior is threatening or harassing, report it. 
                We are dedicated to providing an environment where participants feel welcome and safe.
            </p>
            <p>
                We will use our discretion in determining when and how to follow up on reported incidents, which may range from not 
                taking action to permanent expulsion from the project and project-sponsored spaces. We will notify the accused of 
                the report and provide them an opportunity to discuss it before any action is taken. The identity of the reporter 
                will be omitted from the details of the report supplied to the accused. In potentially harmful situations, 
                such as ongoing harassment or threats to anyone’s safety,we may take action without notice.
